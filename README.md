To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Updating included MIME types database
`LyjiasMimeTypesReference` is generated by running `dat/mime_types.csv` through an included CSV-to-hash script at `etc/csv_to_keyed_hash.rb`. It can be regenerated from the following command, run from the gem root:

    ./csv_to_keyed_hash.rb --file ../dat/mime_types.csv --key mime_type -m LyjiasMimeTypesReference -c TYPES > ../lib/lyjias_mime_types_reference.rb

MIME Type data is sourced from Mozilla's ["Incomplete List of MIME Types"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Complete_list_of_MIME_types)
